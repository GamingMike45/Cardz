# CardzCurrently 
gives you a set of 5 cards. Currently, it is hardcoded, as I had many errors with getting rand 0.8.5 in the dependency to work. 

Features included
- If cards in hand are ascending
- If cards in hand are descending
- if cards are all the same suit
- Total suit number in hand

Feature to be added 
- Randomisation: The player is given random cards to their hand
